 
    Collection of python tools for interacting with VASP 
================================================================================

This project aims to create a one-stop shop for all my python+VASP needs. 

There already exists many excellent tools to interact with VASP from python 
(FireWorks, Pymatgen, ASE); these tools must still be properly integrated into tailored 
solutions for my needs.

Here I want to develop and curate a suite of tools that I can use to perform 
    - task submission
    - data extraction
    - analysis
leveraging existing technology, with nothing else in mind than my own convenience.
