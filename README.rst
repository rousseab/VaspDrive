I find myself constantly solving ad hoc the same problems over and over again, wasting
time and then leaving an approximate solution to code-rot, having to hack away again next
time I find myself facing a similar problem.

Here I want to "develop" and curate a suite of tools that I can use to perform these tasks,
with nothing else in mind than my own convenience.
